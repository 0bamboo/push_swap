- if the size of the stack is bigger or equal 20 {
    - you need to divide the stack to small chunks..
    - start looking for numbers of the first chunk
    - try to shift that number to the top of the stack 
    - use either ra or rra that's depends on the spot of that number
    - if the spot of that number is less than the middle of size of stack use ra
        else use rra.....
    - when u shift that number to the top u need to push it to
        B but check first if that number is bigger or smaller than all number in By
    - when you move all the numbers of the first chunk to B
        work on the second chunk an so on....
    
}
